# MeeMe
Dating app clicker

You need a javascript script playback to use these scripts. [I recommend this one for chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/poakhlngfciodnhlhhgnaaelnpjljija)
## To use
uncomment the last line, likeMe(<amount of times to swipe> , < amount of ms to wait between each swipe>) 
If either of those numbers are too high on POF or okCupid, the server will block your requests, so keep it reasonable. 
  
 ## Suggestions 
I generally do 10 seconds wait time with 200 to 400 swipes. On Tinder, I noticed that I didn't get matches if I swiped right all the time, so I have every 13th one swipe left.
